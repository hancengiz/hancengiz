It's been a very long time since I blogged. I was meaning to start again for
the last a couple months, here it is I'm kicking it off.

I joined [Hepsiburada](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hepsiburada-com) 10
months ago after working at
[Thoughtworks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thoughtworks) as a consultant
and a developer for six years. It has been a quite a good journey so far, I am
working with passionate individuals and great teams. I am facing different
challenges that helps me grow as a leader, architect and at the roots of it as
a developer.

I am currently working with data streaming and search systems heavily and
thinking about how to design a system that is going to support business growth
plans to serve our customer better by ensuring a fast, scalable and reliable
systems.

I will start blogging about architecture, system design and how to use some
open source technology I am in the process of learning, agile teams and
leadership. It will definitely not going to be limited to this because my
learning journey continues and I will try to reflect it here.
