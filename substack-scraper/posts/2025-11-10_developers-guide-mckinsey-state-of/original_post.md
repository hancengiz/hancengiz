##  **What This Is**

This is a **developer-focused analysis** of McKinsey's November 2025 "State of
AI" survey report. Instead of wading through 52 pages of business-speak, I
used Claude Code to extract what actually matters for software engineers and
translate McKinsey's findings into actionable technical insights.

 **The big question I asked:** _" From a developer's perspective, what does
McKinsey's State of AI 2025 report actually mean for my career and daily
work?"_

 **What you 'll find here:**

  *  **📊 McKinsey's data** (1,993 respondents, 105 countries) on AI adoption, scaling challenges, and what separates high performers

  *  **Technical translations** of business concepts into engineering reality

  *  **Real-world context** from 2025 job market data, Big Tech layoffs, and actual implementation patterns

  *  **Actionable guidance** on what skills to learn, what questions to ask, and how to position yourself

 **Not interested in the developer angle?** Read the **[Executive
Summary](https://github.com/hancengiz/research_reports/blob/main/2-analysis/executive-summary-november-2025.md)** for the business leadership perspective on the
same report.

##  **How This Was Created**

I loaded **all seven McKinsey State of AI reports (2020-2025)** into Claude
Code and analyzed them with my [pdf reader
mcp](https://www.cengizhan.com/p/vibe-coded-a-pdf-reader-mcp-tool) to identify
trends, shifts, and patterns over time. This isn't just about the November
2025 report--it's about understanding how [McKinsey's perspective on AI has
evolved and what that means for
developers.](https://github.com/hancengiz/research_reports/blob/main/2-analysis/analysis.md#-mckinseys-current-position-november-2025)

 **Questions I asked Claude Code:**

  * "How has the definition of 'high performers' changed from 2021 to 2025?"

  * "If AI will create more job opportunities in tech, why are there Big Tech layoffs?"

  * "What trends changed between 2023, 2024, and 2025?"

The result is this analysis--combining McKinsey's multi-year survey research
with technical context, market data, trend analysis, and engineering best
practices.

#  **📊 McKinsey's Current Position (November 2025)**

 _A paragraph from the[general analysis document
](https://github.com/hancengiz/research_reports/blob/main/2-analysis/analysis.md#-mckinseys-current-position-november-2025)I generated._

 **The Realistic Assessment:**

📊 **From McKinsey 's November 2025 report:**

  * "Most organizations are still navigating the transition from experimentation to scaled deployment."

  * "While AI tools are now commonplace, most organizations have not yet embedded them deeply enough into their workflows and processes to realize material enterprise-level benefits."

  * "The transition from pilots to scaled impact remaining a work in progress at most organizations."

 **The Path Forward:**

📊 **McKinsey 's recommended practices:**

  * Think transformatively, not incrementally

  * Redesign workflows fundamentally

  * Pursue innovation and growth, not just efficiency

  * Invest heavily and track ROI rigorously

  * Ensure C-suite ownership and commitment

  * Follow comprehensive best practices

  * Build organizational capabilities, not just deploy technology

 **The Ultimate Message:**

📊 **From McKinsey 's November 2025 report:**

> "As AI tools, including agents, improve and companies' capabilities mature,
> the opportunity to embed AI more fully into the enterprise will offer
> organizations new ways to capture value and create competitive advantage."

📊 **Synthesis:** The journey from 2023's "breakout year" to 2025's "agents,
innovation, and transformation" reflects McKinsey's view evolving from
technological excitement to organizational realism - recognizing that AI's
promise remains ahead, but achieving it requires fundamental business
transformation, not just technology adoption.

##  **TL;DR for Developers**

 **The Bottom Line:** Your company is probably using AI (88% are), but they're
likely stuck in pilot hell (68% haven't scaled). The ones succeeding aren't
just adding AI to existing code--they're fundamentally redesigning workflows
and building with AI agents. This is a **systems architecture challenge** ,
not just an API integration problem.

 **Three Critical Insights:**

  1.  **AI Agents are the new frontier** (62% experimenting, 23% scaling)

  2.  **Workflow redesign > Tool adoption** (2.8x gap between high/low performers)

  3.  **Your job is changing, not disappearing** (IT/dev functions seeing headcount increases)

* * *

##  **1\. AI Agents: The Technical Shift You Need to Understand**

###  **What McKinsey Defines as "AI Agents"**

📊 **McKinsey 's Definition:** "AI agents are systems based on foundation
models that can act in the real world. Unlike a gen AI chatbot or copilot,
which is largely reactive, an agentic solution can plan and execute multiple
steps in a workflow."

> orchestration
>     └─ Example: ChatGPT, Copilot prompts   └─ Example: AutoGPT, agent
> frameworks
>  

### **Adoption Reality Check**

📊 **Current State (McKinsey Nov 2025):**

  *  **62%** of organizations are experimenting with or piloting AI agents

  *  **23%** are scaling agents somewhere in their enterprise

  *  **Industries leading:** Technology (24%), Media/Telecom (21%), Healthcare (18%)

 **Where Agents Are Being Deployed:**

  1.  **IT and knowledge management** (most common)

  2.  **Service operations**

  3.  **Software engineering** <- You're here

  4.  **Product development**

###  **The Reality vs. The Hype**

📊 **McKinsey 's Realistic Assessment (Michael Chui):**

"When it comes to agents, it takes hard work to do it well."

>
>   * Building production-ready agents is NOT just using LangChain or AutoGPT
>
>   * You need robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, and human oversight

##  **2\. The Scaling Gap: Why Most AI Projects Fail to Deploy**

###  **Where Organizations Are Stuck**

📊 **McKinsey Data (Nov 2025):**

    
    
    Experimentation:  31% <- Still testing, PoC phase
    Piloting:         30% <- Limited production, single team/use case
    Scaling:          25% <- Multiple teams, cross-functional deployment
    Fully Scaled:      7% <- Enterprise-wide, integrated into core systems
    ────────────────────
    STUCK (not scaling): 68%

###  **Why Technical Teams Get Stuck**

📊 **Why Companies Get Stuck (from McKinsey):**

  1.  **Incremental thinking:** Use-case-by-use-case approach creates technical debt

  2.  **Efficiency-only objectives:** Cost focus limits organizational energy

  3.  **No workflow redesign:** Adding AI to broken processes doesn't transform outcomes

  4.  **IT ownership:** Delegating to IT instead of a CEO-led transformation

  5.  **Incomplete execution:** Following some best practices, but not all 6 dimensions

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **Technical Translation:**
>
> What this means for developers and technical teams:
>
>   1.  **" Incremental thinking creates technical debt"** translates to:
>
>     * Adding AI to existing systems without redesigning architecture
>
>     * Building one-off solutions instead of reusable platforms
>
>     * Result: Fragile integrations, maintenance nightmares
>
>   2.  **" No workflow redesign"** translates to:
>
>     * Just adding AI endpoints to existing code
>
>     * Not rethinking the entire system architecture
>
>     * Missing opportunities for AI-native design patterns
>
>   3.  **" IT ownership without business context"** translates to:
>
>     * Missing MLOps pipelines and AI infrastructure
>
>     * No monitoring/observability for AI systems
>
>     * Building what's asked, not what drives business value
>
>     * Disconnect between technical capability and impact

##  **3\. Workflow Redesign: The #1 Technical Success Factor**

###  **What McKinsey Found**

📊 **Key Finding:**

"Out of 31 variables tested, workflow redesign has **one of the strongest
contributions** to achieving meaningful business impact."

 **Statistics:**

  * Only **21%** of all organizations have fundamentally redesigned workflows

  *  **55%** of high performers redesigned workflows vs **20%** of others ( **2.8x gap** )

  * This is the **highest correlation** with EBIT impact across all factors tested

##  **4\. Your Job: Changing, Not Disappearing**

###  **The Nuanced Reality**

📊 **McKinsey 's Workforce Data (Nov 2025):**

  *  **32%** expect workforce decreases of 3%+ in the next year

  *  **43%** expect little to no change

  *  **13%** expect increases of 3%+

 **Function-Level Breakdown:**

  * 🟢 **Software Engineering/Dev** -> Headcount likely to INCREASE

  * 🟢 **IT** -> Headcount likely to INCREASE

  * 🟢 **Product/Service Development** -> Headcount likely to INCREASE

  * 🔴 **Service Operations** -> Headcount likely to decrease

  * 🔴 **Supply Chain/Inventory** -> Headcount likely to decrease

📊 **McKinsey Quote (Lareina Yee):**

"Even in these early days of adoption, we are seeing changes in the **skills
demanded** for a range of jobs."

###  **Human Oversight Patterns**

📊 **McKinsey Data:**

  *  **27%** review ALL gen AI outputs before use

  *  **27%** review ≤20% of outputs

  *  **Industries with highest oversight:** Business, legal, professional services

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **Design Pattern: Confidence-Based Review**
>  
>  
>     def handle_ai_output(input_data):
>         result = ai_model.predict(input_data)
>         confidence = result.confidence_score
>  
>         if confidence > 0.95:
>             # Auto-approve for high confidence
>             return auto_execute(result)
>         elif confidence > 0.70:
>             # Sample review for medium confidence
>             if random.random() < 0.20:  # 20% review rate
>                 return queue_for_review(result)
>             return auto_execute(result)
>         else:
>             # Always review for low confidence
>             return queue_for_review(result)
>

##  **9\. Common Developer Misconceptions (Corrected)**

###  **Misconception #1: "AI will replace developers"**

📊 **Reality (McKinsey):** IT and product development functions are
**increasing headcount** , not decreasing.

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **The 2025 Market Reality:**
>
>   * Big Tech laid off **178,635 workers** in 2025 (often citing "AI
> efficiency")
>
>   * However, **only 1% of firms** actually report AI as layoff reason (Yale
> research)
>
>   * Tech jobs ARE migrating: From Big Tech -> Finance/Retail/Healthcare
>
>   * Large non-tech companies (Walmart, JP Morgan, United Health) hiring
> thousands
>
>

>
>  **What 's actually happening:**
>
>   * Junior developers using AI become more productive (less junior work
> needed)
>
>   * Senior developers focus on system design, AI integration, oversight
> (more senior work needed)
>
>   * New roles emerge (ML engineers, MLOps, AI safety)
>
>   *  **Job market shifting** : Big Tech contracting, traditional industries
> expanding tech teams
>
>

###  **Misconception #2: "We just need to add ChatGPT API and we're done"**

📊 **Reality (McKinsey):** Only 32% of organizations are scaling AI despite 88%
adoption.

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **Why adding an API isn 't enough:**
>
>   * No monitoring/observability
>
>   * No cost controls
>
>   * No human oversight patterns
>
>   * No workflow redesign
>
>   * No feedback loops for improvement
>
>

###  **Misconception #3: "AI agents will work autonomously right away"**

📊 **Reality (Michael Chui, McKinsey):** "When it comes to agents, it takes
hard work to do it well."

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **The hard parts:**
>
>   * Error handling when agents get stuck
>
>   * State management across multi-step workflows
>
>   * Cost control (agents can burn through API credits)
>
>   * Defining when to escalate to humans
>
>   * Building trust with users
>
>

###  **Misconception #4: "Smaller companies will hire more AI engineers"**

📊 **Reality (McKinsey):** Large companies are hiring AI talent at **2x the
rate** of smaller companies.

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **Why:**
>
>   * Large companies have bigger budgets for specialized roles
>
>   * They can afford comprehensive AI infrastructure
>
>   * They're further along in scaling (47% vs 29%)
>
>

###  **Misconception #5: "High performers just move faster"**

📊 **Reality (McKinsey):** High performers are **3.6x more ambitious** , not
just faster.

>  **This information is from LLM, external sources**
>
>  **Difference:**
>
>   * Others: Add AI to 10 existing processes (incremental)
>
>   * High performers: Redesign the entire business model around AI
> (transformative)
>
>

##  **Final Takeaway: Think Transformatively, Not Incrementally**

📊 **McKinsey 's Core Message (Alex Singla):**

"It pays to think big. The organizations that are building a genuine and
lasting competitive advantage from their AI efforts are the ones that are
thinking in terms of wholesale transformative change that stands to alter
their business models, cost structures, and revenue streams--rather than
proceeding incrementally."

>
> ###  **For Developers, This Means:**
>
>  **Don 't just:**
>
>   * Add AI to your existing code
>
>   * Use Copilot to write boilerplate faster
>
>   * Build one-off AI features
>
>

>
>  **Instead:**
>
>   * Redesign your architecture around AI capabilities
>
>   * Build platforms that enable AI-first workflows
>
>   * Create systems where AI and humans collaborate effectively
>
>   * Think about what's possible if AI handles 80% of the work
>
>

>
>  **The companies winning are not moving incrementally. Neither should you.**
