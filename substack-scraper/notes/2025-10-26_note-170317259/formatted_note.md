Even when I work alone, I still follow the BMAD Method or a similar approach
I've designed. I usually start by "vibing"—exploring ideas, testing
possibilities, and clarifying what I want to accomplish. Even at this early
stage, I open Claude Code and write an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for
every significant decision. This is where I capture my reasoning, trade-offs,
code snippets, and experiments—essentially my thought process in action.
Currently, I’m turning one of those vibe-coded prototypes into production-
ready software, and that prototype already has 12 ADRs. These early records
are now shaping formal specifications, architecture, and delivery plans while
preserving the creative spark that initiated the project. This approach aligns
with Rick Nason’s philosophy in "It’s Not Complicated": some projects are
simple, others are complicated, and some are truly complex. Each type requires
a different level of structure. That’s exactly what I'm integrating into
http://fabriqa.ai (the ai-native sdlc product I am building)—a set of adaptive
workflows for simple, complicated, and complex projects, along with one that
helps convert a prototype into a spec-driven production project. If you're
working solo, you can start crafting your own version of this: 1\. Define your
workflow types (e.g., prototype, simple, complex). 2\. List the document types
you need for each (e.g., ADRs, PRDs, design briefs, test specs). 3\. Define
your AI agents—each with a specific role (e.g., “Spec Reviewer,” “Technical
Architect,” “Compliance Expert”). There are already solid agent templates you
can prompt and adapt using Claude or ChatGPT to specialize in your workflow. –
