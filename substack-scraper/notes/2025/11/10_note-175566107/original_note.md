I was trying to find a name for prompt-based capabilities that can be lazy-loaded that save the context. I invented a term “prompt function” and you could mark them as discoverable. I better rename it to “skill” now then to match the name antrophics gave. :) [https://www.claude.com/blog/skills](https://www.claude.com/blog/skills)
