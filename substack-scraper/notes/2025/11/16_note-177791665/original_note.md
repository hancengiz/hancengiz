Many legacy services are like my bent shoehorn. It still technically works, so nobody touches it. The friction it adds is small enough that I tolerate it. I adjust how I use it, bend it a little, or live with its quirks. But one day it will finally give up, and when it does, I will rewrite it.  Not sure if I should have bought an expensive one initially, when I was furnishing my apartment. I think I am happy with the situation. If you had asked me 15 years ago, I would have made a custom design with my name carved on a costly material. 🤷🏻‍♂️
